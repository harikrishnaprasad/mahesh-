<h1>Mahesh Bio-data</h1>
<p>Ghattamaneni Mahesh Babu was born to Telugu film Superstar Sri Ghattamaneni Sivaramakrishna Murthy, fondly known to one and all as Hero Krishna, and Smt. Indira Devi on 9th August, 1975. Born after brother Ramesh Babu (actor turned producer who established Sri Krishna Productions banner) and two sisters Padmavati (on whose name Padmalaya banner was established) and Manjula (actress, producer who established Indira Productions banner), he became the apple of everyone‘s eye in the family. He also has a third sister, the baby of the family, Priyadarshini. All siblings have the rare honor of having acted in films as child artistes.</p>
<p>Mahesh’s childhood was spent mostly in Madras (Chennai) under the ever loving care of his favorite paternal grandmother Smt. Durgamma and the rest of his family, while his father was busy establishing a name for himself in the Telugu film industry as the most hardworking actor filming in 3 shifts a day. </p>
<p>So as not to miss out on their paternal bonding, Krishna made sure all the children spent sufficient time with him on location and on his sets, especially during holidays. The acting bug, thus started early in Mahesh‘s childhood. The film sets were a second playground and he did not hesitate to face the camera when asked to do a small role in his brother Ramesh Babu‘s debut film, Needa, under Dr. Dasari Narayana Rao‘s direction in 1979, at the tender age of 4. Mahesh studied at St. Bede‘s School in Chennai, where his school mates of the same generation were Surya Siva Kumar (Tamil film actor) and Vishnuvardhan (Tamil film director) while continuing to attend his dad’s filming during holidays.</p>
<p>On one such occasion, in 1983, at the age of 8, director Kodi Ramakrishna requested him to do a role in the film Poratam since they were having difficulty casting for the role of Krishna’s sibling. This was his first full length feature film and can be considered his debut film as a child artist. Producer / Director Dhoondy, one of the early backers of Krishna in his struggling days, watched a preview of the movie and was stunned to find out he was Krishna’s own son and remarked that there was a spark in him and he would become an excellent artist. True to that prognostication, Mahesh went on to win the hearts of many Telugu film lovers as a child artist through varied roles. In Sankharavam (1987) he faced the cameras with his father directing him for the first time. Veteran director A. Kodanda Rami Reddy directed him and his brother Ramesh for Bazaar Rowdy (1988), where he overshadowed his own brother and won accolades for jointly carrying the film on his shoulders. </p>

<p>Veteran director A. Kodanda Rami Reddy directed him and his brother Ramesh for Bazaar Rowdy (1988), where he overshadowed his own brother and won accolades for jointly carrying the film on his shoulders. Mugguru Kodukulu (1988) saw him again team up with his brother and father, the father directing them all this time. This film was his paternal grandmother’s dream project, which she nurtured over the years as a vehicle for her 3 sons to act; however, Krishna’s siblings did not show any inclination to act so the project had to be taken up with her grandsons instead of her sons. Krishna, who had earlier given strict instructions to the technicians that Mahesh is not allowed to do any stunts himself, was surprised at the dexterity and skill with which Mahesh effortlessly handled such scenes. Mahesh and the technicians confessed that Mahesh had always done his own stunts even for earlier films despite Krishna’s orders. Mahesh never believed in doing something at the risk of someone else’s life and argued that he would rather put himself in the position of risk than someone else’s child. Ramesh also convinced his dad that his brother spent spare time rehearsing for the stunts including in his own bedroom so that he could execute perfectly without great risk to life and limb - such was his dedication even at that young age. Gudachari 117 (1989) reunited Mahesh with his first film director Kodi Ramakrishna in a James Bond type of flick for which his dad, the lead in the movie, was famous. Koduku Diddina Kapuram (1989), directed by Krishna again, had Mahesh in a dual role in a film based on The Parent Trap. Mahesh overshadowed the rest of cast, leading senior actor Mohan Babu to comment “ Ee budathadu manalni mingesthunnaadu,” Balachandrudu and Anna Tammudu (1990) saw the teenaged Mahesh Babu completing his first innings on celluloid after which he concentrated on his studies and went out of the public eye while letting nature take its course through the awkward adolescent years.</p>
